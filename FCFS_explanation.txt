FCFS.c - First Come First Serve Page Replacement Algorithm
============================================================

LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:

Line 1: #include<stdio.h>
- Includes standard input/output library for printf and scanf functions

Line 2-3: int main()
- Main function where program execution begins

Line 4: int incomingStream[] = {4, 1, 2, 4, 5};
- Array containing the sequence of page requests
- Pages 4, 1, 2, 4, 5 will be requested in this order

Line 5: int pageFaults = 0;
- Counter to track total number of page faults (when a page is not in memory)

Line 6: int frames = 3;
- Number of available frames in memory (can hold 3 pages at a time)

Line 7: int m, n, s, pages;
- Loop variables and helper variables
- m, n: loop counters
- s: flag to check if page is already in frame
- pages: total number of page requests

Line 9: pages = sizeof(incomingStream)/sizeof(incomingStream[0]);
- Calculates number of pages in the incoming stream
- sizeof(array)/sizeof(element) gives array length

Line 11: printf("Incoming \t Frame 1 \t Frame 2 \t Frame 3");
- Prints header for the output table

Line 12: int temp[frames];
- Creates array to store current pages in frames

Line 13-16: for(m = 0; m < frames; m++) { temp[m] = -1; }
- Initializes all frames to -1 (indicating empty frames)

Line 18-50: Main processing loop - for(m = 0; m < pages; m++)
- Processes each page request one by one

Line 20: s = 0;
- Reset flag for each new page request
- s will be set to 1 if page is found in frames

Line 22-29: Inner loop checking if page already exists in frames
- for(n = 0; n < frames; n++)
- Checks each frame to see if current page is already loaded

Line 24-28: if(incomingStream[m] == temp[n])
- If page is found in frames:
  - Increment s (page hit)
  - Decrement pageFaults (we incremented it optimistically, so undo that)

Line 30: pageFaults++;
- Assume page fault initially
- Will be decremented if page is found (lines 27)

Line 32-35: if((pageFaults <= frames) && (s == 0))
- If frames are not yet full AND page not found:
- Place page directly in the next available frame position

Line 36-39: else if(s == 0)
- If frames are full AND page not found:
- Replace page using FCFS (circular replacement)
- (pageFaults - 1) % frames gives the position to replace

Line 41-49: Display current state
- Line 42: Print the current page number
- Lines 43-48: Print contents of all frames
  - If frame has a page (not -1), print the page number
  - If frame is empty (-1), print "-"

Line 52: printf("\nTotal Page Faults:\t%d\n", pageFaults);
- Display final count of page faults

Line 53: return 0;
- End program successfully

ALGORITHM SUMMARY:
==================
FCFS (First Come First Serve) is the simplest page replacement algorithm:
1. Pages are loaded into frames in order
2. When frames are full, the oldest page (first in) is replaced
3. Uses circular queue concept (modulo operator for wrap-around)
4. Not optimal - doesn't consider page usage patterns

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
===============
With incoming stream {4, 1, 2, 4, 5} and 3 frames:
- Load 4 → Frame 1
- Load 1 → Frame 2  
- Load 2 → Frame 3
- Request 4 → Already in Frame 1 (no fault)
- Load 5 → Replace 4 in Frame 1 (oldest)

Total Page Faults: 4
